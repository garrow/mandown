  bibdown --- part of the Mandown set of tools.
  
  bibdown processes standard input, builds a bibliography from a YAML-format set 
  of references and inserts citation keys.
  
  Copyright Â© 2008 Chris Rose. 
  Distributed according to the GNU General Public License.
  
  Usage:
  ------
  cat infile.txt | bibdown > outfile.txt
  
  Syntax:
  -------
  
  Place references at the end of your Markdown file in a level 1 section 
  called 'Bibliography' using the exact string '# Bibliography' (as given in the 
  example below). Cite references in your text using 'cite:MyKey', where 'MyKey' 
  is a key to one of your references. Keys may contain any characters, but end 
  with a space character (i.e. 'cite:SomeKey' refers to the key 'SomeKey', while 
  'cite:Some Key' refers to the key 'Some').
  
  ------------------------------- Example -------------------------------------
  ...
  This is some text that needs to cite the very important work of Jones and 
  Smith cite:Jones.
  ...
  
  # Bibliogrqaphy
  
  Jones:
    authors:  Jones, Bob & Smith, Fred J.
    title:    Spaghetti-Wall Interactions
    journal:  Am. J. Pasta Phys.
    volume:   3
    number:   2
    month:    January
    year:     2008
    pages:    111--112
    note:     In press.
  ------------------------------- End of example ------------------------------
  
  Suppoted fields:
  ----------------
  
  The following fields are supported by bibdown and all are optional; you may 
  use other arbitrarily-named fields, but they will be ignored (by this version 
  of bibdown, at least).
  
  authors -- Use 'surname, first names' format; separate authors with '&'.
      e.g. "Einstein, Albert & Bohr, Neils"
  organization -- Use if the publication is authored by an organization.
      e.g. "Amnesty International"
  title -- The title of the reference.
      e.g. "Some Clever Stuff on Quantum Physics"
  journal -- The name of the journal; this field causes the reference to be 
             treated as an article in a journal.
      e.g. "Int. J. Quan. Phys."
  conference -- The name of the conference; this field causes the reference to 
                be treated as a paper in a conference proceedings.
      e.g. "Medical Image Understanding and Analysis"
  booktitle -- The title of a book; this field causes the reference to be 
               treated as a book.
      e.g. "Moby Dick"
  chapter -- The chapter in a book being cited; only valid for references 
             that use the booktitle field.
      e.g. "4"
  edition -- The edition of a book being cited; only valid for references 
             that use the booktitle field.
      e.g. "5"
  editors -- The editors of a book being cited; only valid for references 
             that use the booktitle field.
      e.g. "Harris, Thomas & Hopper, Dennis"
  isbn -- The ISBN number of a book being cited; only valid for references 
          that use the booktitle field. 
      e.g. "9783540356257"
  month -- The month of publication.
      e.g. "January"
  volume -- The volume of the publication being cited.
      e.g. "2"
  number -- The number/issue of the journal article being cited; only valid for 
            references that use the journal field.
      e.g. "2"
  pages -- The pages in the publication being referred to.
      e.g. "201--211"
  series -- The series the book being cited belongs to; only valid for 
            references that use the booktitle field.
      e.g. "Mathematical Statistics"
  url -- A URL for the publication being cited.
      e.g. "http://www.something.com/somedocument"
  accessed -- The date the URL was accessed (note: do not use this field without 
              also including a URL).
      e.g. "28 January 2008"
  year -- The year the publication being cited was published.
      e.g. 2008
  note -- Any notable comment about the publication being cited.
      e.g. "In press."
  
  
  Notes:
  ------
  
  You must use soft tabs (emulated using spaces) in the bibliography. If you 
  need to include a colon in the reference (e.g. in the title field), you 
  will need to surround the field entry in quotes (e.g. "title:  'Gnocci: nasty 
  or nice?'").
  
  If you are going to process the resulting file (outfile.txt, in the usage 
  example given above), you may wish to use a double-dash for page ranges 
  (and be sure to use the 'smart typography' mode of Pandoc)---see the example 
  above.
